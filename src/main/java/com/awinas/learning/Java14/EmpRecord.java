/*
 * Few important things to note about Records:
 * 
 * A record can neither extend a class nor it can be extended by another class.
 * Itâ€™s a final class. Records cannot be abstract Records cannot extend any
 * other class and cannot define instance fields inside the body. Instance
 * fields must be defined in the state description only Declared fields are
 * private and final The body of a record allows static fields and methods
