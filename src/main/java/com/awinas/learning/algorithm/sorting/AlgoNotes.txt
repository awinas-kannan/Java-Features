Sorting Algorithm:

	Bubble Sort: (Swapping)
	Selection Sort: (Finding min Index and Swapping to first) 
	Insertion Sort: (Shifting)
	Quick Sort
	Mer...

Arrays.sort() (uses Dual-Pivot Quicksort for primitives and Timsort for objects)
Collections.sort() (uses Timsort for sorting lists)
List.sort() (also uses Timsort)
Arrays.parallelSort() (uses parallel sorting for large arrays)


a) Bubble Sort (Move the large elment to the last by continuously swapping)
	Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
	Moves the largest element to the last index , Then to last index - 1 ,then last index -2 for each iteration
	Time Complexity: O(n²)
	Best for: Small datasets, easy to implement.

b) Selection Sort (Select the min index and move to first)
	Finds the minimum element and places it in the correct position iteratively.
	Find the Min index -> move to position 1, then postition 2 ...
	Time Complexity: O(n²)
	Best for: Small datasets.	
	
c) Insertion Sort ( Start from num 2(i) and check from 0 - index of the number i ,shift if its a 
	Builds a sorted list by inserting each element at its correct position.
	Time Complexity: O(n²) (Best case: O(n) for nearly sorted data)
	Best for: Small or nearly sorted datasets.	
	
d) Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)
	Divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and merges them.
	Time Complexity: O(n log n)
	Best for: Large datasets, stable sorting.
