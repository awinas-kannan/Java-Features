Sorting Algorithm:

	Bubble Sort:
	Selection Sort:
	Insertion Sort:
	Quick Sort
	Mer...

Arrays.sort() (uses Dual-Pivot Quicksort for primitives and Timsort for objects)
Collections.sort() (uses Timsort for sorting lists)
List.sort() (also uses Timsort)
Arrays.parallelSort() (uses parallel sorting for large arrays)


a) Bubble Sort
	Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
	Moves the largest element to the last index
	Time Complexity: O(n²)
	Best for: Small datasets, easy to implement.

b) Selection Sort
	Finds the minimum element and places it in the correct position iteratively.
	Time Complexity: O(n²)
	Best for: Small datasets.
