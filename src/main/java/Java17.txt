Java 17 was released on September 14, 2021. 
Java 17 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release, like Java 11 and Java 8. 
Oracle will support it for bug fixes, patches and performance enhancements for the next few years.

As Java 17 is an LTS release, and major popular frameworks (e.g., Spring 6 and Spring Boot 3) will be supporting the new features, 
it is better to plan for Java 17 migration.

1. Pattern Matching for Switch (Preview)
   PatterMatcher17.java
    ‘–enable-preview‘ 
    
    int getNumberOfSides(Shape shape) {
    return switch (shape) {
        case WeirdTriangle t -> t.getNumberOfSides();
        case Circle c -> c.getNumberOfSides();
        case Triangle t -> t.getNumberOfSides();
        case Rectangle r -> r.getNumberOfSides();
        case Square s -> s.getNumberOfSides();
    };
}

2. Sealed Classes
    In Java 17, it has become a standard feature with no changes to what was available in Java 16.
