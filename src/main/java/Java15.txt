1. Sealed Classes and Interfaces (Preview) (JEP 360)
	https://howtodoinjava.com/java15/sealed-classes-interfaces/
	
	A sealed class or interface restricts which other classes or 
	interfaces may extend or implement them. Conceptually, 
	it is a more declarative way than access modifiers to restrict the use of a class or 
	interface as a parent class or as a parent interface.
	
	The reserved keyword permits lists all the classes that can extend the sealed class directly. 
	The listed subclasses can either be final, non-sealed, or sealed.
	
	1.1. sealed modifier and permits keyword
	
2. Pattern Matching for instanceof (Second Preview) (JEP 375)

	//Allowed to use s in complex condition
	if (obj instanceof String s && s.startsWith("a")) {
	  System.out.println(s);
	}
	
	//compiler error
	if (obj instanceof String s || s.startsWith("a")) {
	  System.out.println(s);  
	}	
	
3. Records (Second Preview) (JEP 384)
	   In the second preview, Records have some minor changes. 
	   Now fields inside a record should not be modified via reflection as it will throw IllegalAccessException.
	   
	   Records are meant to be data carrier classes and you should totally avoid defining native methods in them.


4. Text Blocks (JEP 378)
       Text blocks are finally a standard feature in Java 15. A text block is a multi-line string literal.
