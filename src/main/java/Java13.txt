Java 13 was released for production use on 17th September 2019. 
There are not a lot of developer-specific features in Java 13 because of the 6-month release cycle.

1. Text Blocks - JEP 355

TextBlocks13.java

 The string object created using text blocks has no additional properties. 
 It’s an easier way to create multiline strings. We can’t use text blocks to create a single-line string. 
 The opening triple-double quotes must be followed by a line terminator.
 
 2. New Methods in String Class for Text Blocks
 
 TextBlocksStrMethods13.java
 
 There are three new methods in the String class, associated with the text blocks feature.

		1.formatted(Object… args): it’s similar to the String format() method. 
		It’s added to support formatting with the text blocks.
		
		2.stripIndent(): used to remove the incidental white space characters from the beginning 
		and end of every line in the text block. This method is used by the text blocks 
		and it preserves the relative indentation of the content.
		
		3.translateEscapes(): returns a string whose value is this string, 
		with escape sequences translated as if in a string literal.
 
 3. Switch Expressions Enhancements - JEP 354

 SwitchEnhance13.java
 Switch expressions were added as a preview feature in Java 12 release. 
 In Java 12, we can use break to return a value from a switch.

 It’s almost same in Java 13 except that the “break” has been replaced with “yield” 
 to return a value from the case statement.
