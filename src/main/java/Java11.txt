1) Launch Single-File Programs Without Compilation
we donâ€™t need to compile the Java source files with javac explicitly anymore:

$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld 
Hello Java 8!
Copy
Instead, we can directly run the file using the java command:

$ java HelloWorld.java
Hello Java 11!

2)HTTP Client API
Now the Java applications can make HTTP communications without the need to any external dependency.
